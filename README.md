# Global Terrorism Dataset - Statistical Analysis and  Obtained Results using SAS
The dataset used in this report consists of 26 variables and 5,962 observations. Our team started this project asking interesting questions about our dataset. To answer them, we ran multiple tests such as linear/logistic regression, moderation analysis, and test of independence. In addition, with all our models being significant, we came up with an abundance of interesting findings about the global terrorism dataset. In our project, we used SAS University Edition to extract and interpret data by applying various statistical methods.
